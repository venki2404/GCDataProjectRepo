Introduction
------------

This CodeBook pertains to data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and pertains to Human Activity Recognition.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, a full set of raw measurements were recorded. A summarized, simplfied and tidy version of the data set has been created and is being described in this document.

Original Input "raw" Data Set
-----------------------------

To obtains details fo the original data set please see [link] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Data Set transformations
------------------------

The **key** Data Set transformations to covert the original data set to the present data set includes:

1. Tidy up the data set by creating a table with rows for observations and key variables as columns. Also includes merging the test and train data sets of the original data set, besides other.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Provide only average of each variable for each subject and each activity (from the several observations made of each subject and each activity)

Data Set Description
--------------------

The Data set is captured in a table with 180 observations (rows) for 68 variables (columns). The 180 observations result from observations made for 30 volunteers (subjects) each of whom do 6 activities (180 = 30 x 6). THe variables of the data set are described below. The table provides a summarized and simplified version of the Human activity measurements using a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Variable names: Key mnemonics used
----------------------------------

The following keywords/Mnemonics were used to construct the variable names. Studying them helps to understand the variable names.

---|-------------|-----------
1|t|Prefix 't' denotes time domain signals
2|f|Prefix 'f' denotes frequency domain signals (obtained using FFT)
3|body|body component of signal
4|gravity|gravity component of signal
5|acc|Accelerometer signal measurment
6|gyro|Gyroscope signal measurement
7|jerk|Jerk - body linear acceleration/angular velocity derived in time

**NOTE:** Variables 63-68 have two "body" in the name, while there could just be one. This has been delibrately left to be consistent with the description of features in the orginal raw data set. This is in case user decides to refer back to the original data

Units of Variables
------------------

All features/variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Hence they have no units. 

Original accelaration signals were measured in standard gravity units 'g'.
Origina gyroscope signals (of angular velocity) were measured in 'radians/second'
